For this exercise we were given the HTML, CSS and some JS to start out with. It was pretty difficult for me to find a starting point after declaring the variables, but after enough searching and googling for help, I was able to find a mix of code that I understood and I put it together to make it work.

In the following image you will see the prompt for us to input the length of the password.
